# n chooses r

Read Detailed Formulation [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.html)

Since we have this formula 
$$^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}=\frac{n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times .....\times(n-r+1)}{r!}$$
We can code this one quickly though its not very efficient method to find nCr.
```cpp
int getNCR(int n, int k){
    int res = 1;
    for(int i = n-k+1; i<=n; i++) res *= i;
    for(int i = 1; i<=k; i++) res /= i;
    return res;
}
```


# Connection With Pascal Triangle and Better way to Find nCr

![[ncr1.png]]
Every element in Pascal Triangle represents a combination and there a lot of interesting relations between them.
 - nCr Corresponds to the (r+1)th element of (n+1)th column. For example : $^5C_3$ = 10 which is in 6th row and 4th column
 - So, to get nCr we need the Pascal Triangle up to (n+1)th row at least.

We can write code to build this Pascal Triangle.
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std;

const int N = 6;
int P[N+1][N+1];

void buildPascal(){
    P[1][1] = 1;    
    for(int i = 2; i<=N; i++)
        for(int m = 1; m <= i; m++)
            P[i][m] = P[i-1][m-1] + P[i-1][m];
}



int main(){
    buildPascal();
    // 5 C 3
    int n = 5;
    int r = 3;
    cout << P[n+1][r+1] << endl;
}


```

Now we want to calculate nCr then we don't need the whole pascal triangle, right?
we need only nth and (n+1)th row. Thus we can calculate nCr without having space complexity issue of 2D array.

```cpp

int getNCR(int n, int r){
    const int N = n+1;
    int P[3][N+1];
    memset(P,0,sizeof(P));
    P[1][1] = 1;    
    int rowCnt = 2;
    int i = 2;
    while(rowCnt <= N){
        for(int m = 1; m <= rowCnt; m++){
            if(i==1) P[i][m] = P[i+1][m-1] + P[i+1][m];
            else P[i][m] = P[i-1][m-1] + P[i-1][m];
        }
        i = (rowCnt%2)+1;
        rowCnt++;
    }
    if(n%2) return P[2][r+1];
    else return P[1][r+1];
}

```
