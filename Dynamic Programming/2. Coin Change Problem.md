Coin Change has a greedy approach but that doesn't work for all sets of coin values. This is discussed in the CP-4 book, greedy chapter.

## Variant 1
- Different coins are given 
- One coin can be used multiple times
- Is it possible to make n using the given coins.


**A simple problem statement :**
`coins = [4,7,10]` 
`n = 15` 
Is it possible to make n using the given coins ? 

I'm trying to come up with a DP Bottom Up solution for this problem.
